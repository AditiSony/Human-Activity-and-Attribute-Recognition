# **Human Activity and Personal Attribute Recognition from Smartphone-based Sensor Data**

Welcome to my project on predicting personal attributes of subjects alongside predicting activity being performed from smartphone-based sensor data! This file introduces you to how to reproduce work done and the requirements.

Folder structure for all files is as below-
+ Data folder contains all the raw data files.
+ Source_code folder contains the jupyter notebook containing all source code used for development purpose.
+ Reports folder contains a pdf copy for the final report on the project.

All work done is in Jupyter Notebook using Python3 as programming language and its various libraries.

You'll first need to set your working directory into the folder where all datafiles are located.

Next, all requirements for running of this project are mentioned in the section “Importing Required Libraries” in the source code file. Please ensure these are installed in your system before running the code file. Any library can be installed using the command “pip install library name” from the Jupyter notebook cell or through console.

Then, in the section “Loading data and initial pre-processing”, change the filepath to the data folder of the project where raw data files are stored in your local machine.
Once done all the source code can be run and work can be reproduced. Please note accuracy score can vary slightly from as reported in the final report (due to stochastic nature of the algorithm), however the difference should not be much.
